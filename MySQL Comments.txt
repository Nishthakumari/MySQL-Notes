Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:

-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;


The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore the end of a line:
SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';


The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore a statement:
-- SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Products;
