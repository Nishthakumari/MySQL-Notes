The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City = 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

UPDATE Multiple Records
It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.

UPDATE Customers
SET PostalCode = 00000
WHERE Country = 'Mexico';

Update Warning!
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!

UPDATE Customers
SET PostalCode = 00000;
