The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

DELETE FROM table_name;

DELETE FROM Customers;
